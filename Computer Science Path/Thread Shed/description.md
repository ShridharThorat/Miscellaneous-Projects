# Thread Shed

Youâ€™ve recently been hired as a cashier at the local sewing hobby shop, ***Thread Shed***. Some of your daily responsibilities involve tallying the number of sales during the day, calculating the total amount of money made, and keeping track of the names of the customers.

Unfortunately, the ***Thread Shed*** has an extremely outdated register system and stores all of the transaction information in one huge unwieldy string called `daily_sales`.

All day, for each transaction, the name of the customer, amount spent, types of thread purchased, and the date of sale is all recorded in this same string. Your task is to use your Python skills to iterate through this string and clean up each transaction and store all the information in easier-to-access lists.

## Instructions

### First, take a minute to inspect the string daily_sales in the code editor.

    How is each transaction stored? How is each piece of data within the transaction stored?

    Start thinking about how we can split up this string into its individual pieces of data.
